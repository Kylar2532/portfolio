        Alex graduated from the University of Minnesota -- Twin Cities in December
        2023 with a Bachelor's of Arts in Computer Science and minor in Music.
        He was offered a spot in the University's Computer Science Master's 
        program, which he is thrilled to accept and is eagerly awaiting the
        start of. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to programming, Alex has two primary loves: graphics 
        (including animation) and functional programming. He is planning on
        specializing in graphics during his Master's program, but as of the
        current moment is undecided which niche he will focus on. In an ideal
        world, he would be able to create graphics and animations (suffice to 
        say, one of his current not-yet-ready-for-public-premier projects is to
        create complete graphics and animation libraries for functional
        langauges such as OCaml and F#).
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, Alex has had the joy of being an Undergraduate
        Teaching Assistant at the University of Minnesota for the CS course
        Advanced Programming Principles; the functional programming course
        required for any Computer Science degree. During this time, Alex was
        frequently questioned be students (rather increduously) why he loves
        OCaml so much, and told that the only other person students had met whose
        genuine passion for the language matched his was the course professor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of the academic realm, Alex is an avid rock climber and can often
        be found throwing himself up the walls at Minneapolis Bouldering Project
        with his friends. He also enjoys tabletop games, reading books (especially
        fantasy), baking, and spending time with his partner and their cats (and
        encouraging his partner's crochet hobby by regularly sending him fun new
        patterns).
