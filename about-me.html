        Alex graduated from the University of Minnesota -- Twin Cities in December
        2023 with a Bachelor's of Arts in Computer Science and minor in Music.
        He was offered a spot in the University's Computer Science Master's 
        program, which he is thrilled to accept and is eagerly awaiting the
        start of.

        Outside of the academic realm, Alex is an avid rock climber and can often
        be found throwing himself up the walls at Minneapolis Bouldering Project
        with his friends. He also enjoys tabletop games, reading books (especially
        fantasy), baking, and spending time with his partner and their cats (and
        encouraging his partner's crochet hobby by regularly sending him fun new
        patterns).
